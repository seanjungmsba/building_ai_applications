## 💼 Use Cases

> 🚀 Real-world applications where transformers are game-changers.

### 🌍 1. Machine Translation
- Translate spoken or written languages.
- Convert code between programming languages (e.g., Python ↔ Java).

### ❓ 2. Question Answering
- Extract answers from a body of text.
- Build interactive Q&A bots.

### ✍️ 3. Text Generation
- Generate text from prompts (chatbots, story generation).
- Summarize long documents or emails.

### 📊 4. Text Classification
- Classify sentiment (positive, neutral, negative).
- Tag emails, spam filtering, or topic categorization.

### 🧾 5. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Identify and label people, organizations, locations, dates, etc.
- Useful in compliance, finance, and medical NLP pipelines.
