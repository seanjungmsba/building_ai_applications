# 🧠 Instruction Finetuning with LLaMA 3.1 + Unsloth

Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on domain-specific instruction-response datasets significantly boosts performance on specialized tasks. This project demonstrates how to fine-tune **Meta's LLaMA 3.1 8B** model using **Unsloth**, a fast and efficient training library, to produce a lightweight, domain-adapted instruction model.

## 📌 Description

Structured instruction tuning involves retraining a pre-trained LLM with high-quality instruction-response data. This process refines the model’s capabilities within a specific domain, enabling:

* More accurate completions
* Better adherence to formatting
* Context-aware reasoning for narrow tasks

## ✅ Benefits

| Advantage                  | Description                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🎯 **Domain Expertise**    | Fine-tuned models internalize nuances specific to your field |
| 📈 **Improved Accuracy**   | Outperforms generic models on similar structured tasks       |
| ❌ **Fewer Hallucinations** | Less likely to generate irrelevant or misleading answers     |

## 📚 Dataset Requirements

A well-prepared dataset is essential for meaningful fine-tuning. Your dataset should:

* Reflect the target domain comprehensively
* Include diverse question/answer pairs
* Maintain consistency in instruction/response formatting
* Be free from noise, duplicates, or bias
* Ideally contain **5k–100k** examples

---

### 📄 Example Format

We structure each sample as a JSON object with `instruction` and `response` fields:

```json
[
  {
    "instruction": "Explain the difference between an atom and a molecule.",
    "response": "An atom is the smallest unit of an element... while a molecule is two or more atoms bonded together."
  }
]
```

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. LLaMA 3.1 Access

Before training, request access to **`meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B`** through HuggingFace:
🔗 [Request Access Here](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B)

## 🚀 Finetuning Walkthrough

All fine-tuning logic lives inside [`fine-tune-llama.py`](#canvas:fine-tune-llama.py). This script performs the following:

1. **Loads and formats** instruction data
2. **Initializes LLaMA 3.1** with 4-bit precision for efficient GPU usage
3. Applies **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** for parameter-efficient tuning
4. Configures training parameters with `FastLanguageModel.get_trainer`
5. **Fine-tunes the model** over 3 epochs
6. Saves the trained model locally
7. Runs a test prompt for validation

All methods are thoroughly documented in the Python script.

## 🔍 Sample Output (Post Training)

Prompt:

```
### Instruction:
What is the difference between covalent and ionic bonds?

### Response:
```

Sample output from fine-tuned model:

> Covalent bonds involve the sharing of electron pairs between atoms, while ionic bonds are formed when one atom donates an electron to another...
