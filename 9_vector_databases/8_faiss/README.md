# 🧠 Faiss + LangChain + OpenAI Embeddings

This project is a comprehensive guide and implementation of a vector-based semantic search system using:

* **Faiss**: A powerful vector indexing library built by Facebook AI Research
* **LangChain**: A framework for building LLM-powered applications
* **OpenAI Embeddings**: High-quality embeddings from OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-large` model

This integration is ideal for implementing **semantic search**, **RAG pipelines**, **document similarity**, and **AI-powered recommendations** at blazing-fast speeds with fine-grained customization.

## ⚙️ Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have:

* **Python ≥ 3.8** installed
* An **OpenAI account and API key**
* Sufficient **RAM** to perform in-memory vector operations
* (Optional) A compatible **NVIDIA GPU** to install and leverage `faiss-gpu`

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

Install the packages listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you prefer manual installation:

```bash
pip install faiss-cpu langchain-openai langchain-community python-dotenv numpy
```

**To enable GPU acceleration:**

```bash
pip install faiss-gpu
```

### 2. Configure API Access

Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI credentials:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...your-openai-api-key...
```

### 3. Run Custom Faiss Indexing Demo

```bash
python faiss_index.py
```

This script will:

* Generate and normalize sample vectors
* Add them to a Faiss index (with cosine similarity via inner product)
* Store metadata (IDs, source, and text)
* Save the index and metadata for persistence
* Execute a sample query with optional filtering

### 4. Run LangChain Integration Example

```bash
python faiss_langchain_example.py
```

This script will:

* Generate document embeddings via OpenAI
* Store them in a FAISS index using LangChain’s abstraction
* Perform similarity search and retrieval
* Demonstrate filtering and scoring with LangChain retrievers

## 🧠 What is Faiss?

**Faiss** (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a vector indexing library developed by Meta AI. It supports **Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN)** and **exact vector search**, designed for **high dimensional and large-scale vector datasets**.

Unlike traditional vector databases, Faiss is:

* Lightweight and **runs in-process**
* Extremely **fast** and **GPU-compatible**
* Fully **customizable** via various index types
* Ideal for embedding in ML and AI pipelines

---

## ✅ Key Features

* 🚀 **In-memory performance**: optimized for RAM or GPU use
* 📐 **Index diversity**: Flat, IVF, PQ, HNSW, OPQ, and more
* 🎛️ **Manual tuning**: Control over precision/speed tradeoffs
* 📦 **No external services**: No servers, APIs, or databases to run
* ⚡ **GPU Acceleration**: Seamless performance gains with CUDA

---

## 🔄 How Persistence is Handled

Faiss does not handle storage or metadata. This project demonstrates how to:

* Save the raw index using `faiss.write_index`
* Store associated metadata (IDs, text, source) using `pickle`
* Reload both index and metadata for future queries
* Reconstruct full search results with scores and metadata

---

## 🔍 LangChain + Faiss Integration

The `faiss_langchain_example.py` script uses:

* `OpenAIEmbeddings` to transform natural language to dense vectors
* `FAISS` vector store from `langchain_community`
* `Document` abstraction with metadata fields
* Threshold-based filtering using LangChain’s retriever interface

Use cases include:

* Context injection in RAG pipelines
* Tweet/news/article clustering
* LLM-based document classification
