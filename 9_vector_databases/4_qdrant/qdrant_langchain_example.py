qdrant_langchain_example.py

This script demonstrates how to use QDrant with LangChain:
- Connect to a QDrant collection
- Add documents with OpenAI embeddings
- Perform similarity search and retrieve results

Dependencies:
    - langchain-qdrant
    - langchain-openai
    - langchain-core
    - qdrant-client
